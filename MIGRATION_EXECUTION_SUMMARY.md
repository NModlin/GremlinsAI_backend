```

## 🔧 **Dual-Write System Architecture**

### **Service Integration Pattern**
```python
# Example: Chat History Service Integration
if dual_write_service.is_dual_write_enabled:
    success, conv_id, error_info = await dual_write_service.write_conversation(
        db, conversation_data
    )
    if not success:
        logger.error(f"Dual-write failed: {error_info}")
        # Handle fallback or error
else:
    # Standard SQLite-only operation
    conversation = Conversation(...)
    db.add(conversation)
    await db.commit()
```

### **Configuration Management**
```python
# Migration configuration in app/core/config.py
class Settings(BaseSettings):
    dual_write_enabled: bool = Field(default=False)
    migration_mode: str = Field(default="sqlite_only")
    weaviate_primary: bool = Field(default=False)
```

### **Error Handling and Fallback**
```python
# Dual-write with automatic fallback
try:
    # Write to SQLite first (always succeeds)
    sqlite_success = await write_to_sqlite(data)
    
    # Write to Weaviate if dual-write enabled
    if dual_write_enabled:
        weaviate_success = await write_to_weaviate(data)
        if not weaviate_success:
            # Log warning but don't fail operation
            log_security_event("dual_write_failure", severity="medium")
    
    return True, record_id, None
except Exception as e:
    # Rollback and return error
    await rollback_transaction()
    return False, None, str(e)
```
