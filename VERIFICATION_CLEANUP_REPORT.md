### Configuration Updates
- **✅ .gitignore Enhancement**: Added patterns for temporary files, build artifacts, and documentation files
- **✅ Environment Configuration**: Verified test and production environment setups
- **✅ Database Configuration**: Confirmed SQLite and async database setup

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Recommendations

### Non-Critical Warnings
1. **Qdrant Connection**: Vector store service not running (expected in development)
2. **Multi-modal Dependencies**: Some optional packages not installed (OpenCV, Whisper, PyTorch)
3. **Pydantic Warnings**: Some remaining deprecation warnings from third-party packages

### Missing Test Suite
- **❌ Test Files**: Test directories exist but contain no test files
- **📝 Recommendation**: Implement comprehensive test suite based on existing test plan (`GremlinsTest.txt`)
- **🔧 Infrastructure**: Test configuration and utilities are properly set up

### Recommended Next Steps
1. **Create Test Suite**: Implement unit, integration, and e2e tests
