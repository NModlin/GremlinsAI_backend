## üìù **Step-by-Step Recovery Procedure**

### **Phase 1: Disaster Declaration and Assessment (0-30 minutes)**

#### **Step 1.1: Declare Disaster**
- [ ] Incident Commander declares disaster
- [ ] Notify all recovery team members
- [ ] Activate disaster recovery communication channels
- [ ] Document incident start time and initial assessment

#### **Step 1.2: Assess Damage**
- [ ] Identify affected systems and services
- [ ] Determine scope of data loss
- [ ] Evaluate infrastructure availability
- [ ] Estimate recovery complexity and timeline

#### **Step 1.3: Stakeholder Communication**
- [ ] Notify executive leadership
- [ ] Update status page with incident information
- [ ] Communicate with customers via established channels
- [ ] Set up regular status update schedule

### **Phase 2: Infrastructure Provisioning (30 minutes - 2 hours)**

#### **Step 2.1: Prepare Recovery Environment**
```bash
# Set up recovery workspace
export RECOVERY_ENV="disaster-recovery"
export BACKUP_BUCKET="gremlinsai-prod-backups"
export AWS_REGION="us-east-1"

# Create recovery directory
mkdir -p ~/disaster-recovery
cd ~/disaster-recovery
```

#### **Step 2.2: Provision Kubernetes Infrastructure**
```bash
# Deploy Kubernetes cluster (if needed)
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/namespace.yaml
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/configmaps/
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/secrets/

# Deploy core infrastructure
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/weaviate-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/redis-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/monitoring-stack.yaml
```

#### **Step 2.3: Verify Infrastructure Readiness**

### **Phase 3: Data Restoration (1-3 hours)**

#### **Step 3.1: Restore Weaviate Data**
```bash
# Download latest Weaviate backup
aws s3 cp s3://${BACKUP_BUCKET}/weaviate/prod/latest.tar.gz ./weaviate-backup.tar.gz

# Extract backup
tar -xzf weaviate-backup.tar.gz

# Execute Weaviate restoration
./scripts/restore/restore_weaviate.sh \
  --backup-path ./weaviate_backup \
  --weaviate-url http://weaviate.gremlinsai.svc.cluster.local:8080 \
  --environment prod
```

#### **Step 3.2: Restore Redis Data**
```bash
# Download latest Redis backup
