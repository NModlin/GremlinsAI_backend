## 🚨 **Bottleneck Identification**

### **Critical Bottlenecks**

#### **1. Vector Search Performance (HIGH PRIORITY)**
- **Issue**: Weaviate query latency increases significantly above 800 concurrent users
- **Impact**: RAG endpoint P99 latency exceeds 2s threshold
- **Root Cause**: Vector index fragmentation and memory pressure
- **Recommendation**: Implement index optimization and increase Weaviate memory allocation

#### **2. JWT Token Generation (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
- **Issue**: Authentication endpoint shows latency spikes under high concurrency
- **Impact**: User login experience degradation
- **Root Cause**: Synchronous token generation with cryptographic operations
- **Recommendation**: Implement token generation caching and async processing

### **Minor Bottlenecks**

#### **3. File Upload Processing (LOW PRIORITY)**
- **Issue**: Large file uploads (>100KB) show increased processing time
- **Impact**: Document upload endpoint latency variance
- **Root Cause**: Synchronous file processing pipeline
- **Recommendation**: Implement async background processing for large files

#### **4. WebSocket Connection Scaling (LOW PRIORITY)**
- **Issue**: WebSocket connection establishment failures at >1200 concurrent users
- **Impact**: Real-time collaboration feature availability
- **Root Cause**: Connection pool exhaustion
- **Recommendation**: Increase WebSocket connection pool size and implement connection recycling

```

### **Long-term Improvements (Low Priority)**

#### **5. Database Indexing Strategy**
```sql
-- Weaviate index optimization
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_documents_vector_optimized 
ON documents USING ivfflat (embedding_vector) 
WITH (lists = 1000);

-- Add composite indexes for common query patterns
CREATE INDEX idx_documents_user_created 
ON documents(user_id, created_at DESC);
```

#### **6. Async Processing Pipeline**
```python
# Implement background task processing
CELERY_BROKER_URL = "redis://redis:6379/1"
CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND = "redis://redis:6379/2"
CELERY_WORKER_CONCURRENCY = 8
CELERY_TASK_ROUTES = {
    'document_processing': {'queue': 'heavy'},
